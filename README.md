## About
Hi — I’m 0.  
I build production-minded web apps (frontend + backend), design AI-powered features, and focus on clear, measurable outcomes. This site showcases my projects, technical writing, and links to live demos and source code.

---

## Highlights
- Project-first layout with demo GIFs, tech stacks, and live + repo links.
- Lightweight, responsive, and SEO-friendly (server-side rendered or static).
- Built for fast demos: “seed demo” script, one-click deployment, and feature toggles for private demos.
